Hello!

This is my website that you are looking at right now.

It is built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), combined with [Radix Colors](https://radix-ui.com/colors) for it's colors system.

Markdown is powered by [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org) and [Twoslash](https://nuxt.com/docs/concepts/components/twoslash).

About me? Well, there's nothing much to say. I'm a developer, and I like to code and design. You can see my [GitHub](https://github.com/taskylizard) for what I'm up to.
